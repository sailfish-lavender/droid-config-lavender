Splitting .ks generation into -configs package.

Currently droid-hal-device is built with mb2 tool on a local machine.

However that does not provide any differentiation between release and devel
builds, and would cause duplicate runs.

Splitting parts which depend on qa_stage_devel macro (set to 1 in mer:core:devel
prjconfig, and to 0 in the remaining mer:core:*) into this OBS-buildable package
is the current approach.
